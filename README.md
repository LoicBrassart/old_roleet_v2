Website developped to train a bit in tech

## Steps to reproduce

### Frontend

#### 1. Initialization

- CRA a `frontend` app
- Delete useless files (and update useful ones which called them)
- Install useful libraries (`node-sass`)
- Add a `reset.css`

#### 2. Basic layout

- Add basic layout components (header, footer, navbar, ...)
- Write a first style pass, to get an idea of your layout

## Used libraries

- `node-sass`: Use .scss files and make for easier styling
