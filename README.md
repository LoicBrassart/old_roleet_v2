## Steps to reproduce

### Frontend

#### 1. Initialization

- CRA a `frontend` app
- Delete useless files (and update useful ones which called them)
- Install useful libraries (`node-sass`)
- Add a `reset.css`

#### 2. Basic layout

- Add basic layout components (header, footer, navbar, ...)
- Write a first style pass, to get an idea of your layout

#### 3. Routing

- Install `react-router-dom`
- Add a BrowserRouter to your app
- Declare your first pages and Routes
- Add links in your app to these routes

## Used libraries

- `node-sass`: Use .scss files and make for easier styling
- `react-router-dom`: Add a router to your app, to ease UX and add browser usability
